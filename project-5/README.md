# Project 5 Proposal



### By: Brian Nguyen



### Project/Goal:

For my passion project, I'll be creating a movie recommendation system. I will be using a mix of supervised and unsupervised learning to generate the recommender. The end-goal is a tunable recommender based on what the user is interested in (something different, similar, director/cast, etc).



### Background:

I've been an avid movie-goer for a long time. Watching a movie is an avenue to escape to a different reality, where a new world is built and you can follow characters that you connect with (or don't connect with and learn their perspective).

I hope that this provides an effective, but different method, of looking for movie recommenders. A lot of recommendations have felt the same during the COVID-19 pandemic and I hope that this can expand the discovery of movies.



### Data:

I will use a master dataset containing the MovieLensm, TMDB, and GroupLens dataset available on Kaggle. The dataset includes an overview of the plot synopsis, directors, user reviews, and more.
