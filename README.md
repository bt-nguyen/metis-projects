## Metis Projects

All these projects were individually produced (with the exception of project 1) by Brian Nguyen. Each project is intended to cover a specific domain of data science:

Project 1 - Navigating through Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, and NumPy\n
Project 2 - Regression\n
Project 3 - Classification\n
Project 4 - Natural Language Processing (NLP)\n
Project 5 - Passion Project\n

The specific project topic (outside the above mentioned) were determined by myself, primarily chosen due to interest in the topic or machine learning techniques learned by handling the data.
